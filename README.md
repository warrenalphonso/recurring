**Recurring** uses [SendGrid's Python API](
https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-python) to send reminder emails to myself. 
I'll [use Heroku to run the Python script periodically](
https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/schedule-a-python-script-on-heroku-a978b2f91ca8
). 

The original intent is to send me the text of each post in the [original 
LW sequences](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/original-sequences). I receive 
daily emails of the posts in sequential order via a link to [this website](
https://www.readthesequences.com/).
